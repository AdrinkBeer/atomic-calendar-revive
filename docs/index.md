# Atomic Calendar Revive

An advanced calendar card for Home Assistant with Lovelace.

Originally created by atomic7777, I have taken over development and re-vitalised the project.

It loads calendar events from Home Assistant - Google calendar component.

It contains two types of views: `Events mode` and `Calendar mode`. You can switch or select the default one.
