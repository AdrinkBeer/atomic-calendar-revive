# Devcontainer

The easiest way to contribute is to spin up a devcontainer with Visual Studio Code (VS Code). It has all the tools that you require included and doesn't interfere with your system.

## Requirements

- Docker
- VS Code
- Remove - Containers (VS Code extension)

# Fork the Repo

* Fork the Atomic Calendar Repo
* Clone the repository to your computer
* Open the repository in VS Code

When you open this repository with VS code you are asked to "Reopen in Container". This will start the build of the container.

If you don't see the notification, open the command pallet and select `Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container`

NOTE:
This devcontainer is configured to work with a remote docker server, if you need a local dockerserver you will need to modify the file `.devcontainer\devcontainer.json`
