## How come Calendar View doesnt who all my items?

By default only 5 events will be pulled from Google Calendar, to change this you need to follow the instructions [here](/atomic-calendar-revive/quickstart#show-more-than-5-events)

## My color scheme is not showing as expected

If your color scheme is not showing as expected and you are using a custom theme, first please swap back to the default theme and see if this resolves the issue.
